## Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains machine learning models developed for predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company. The goal of these models is to identify customers likely to churn so that proactive strategies can be employed to retain them. Using the Telco Customer Churn dataset, the project explores various machine learning techniques, with a special focus on Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. This project includes detailed Jupyter notebooks for each step of the processâ€”from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to model training and evaluation. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can help businesses understand and mitigate customer churn, ultimately enhancing customer retention strategies. Whether you're a data science student, a professional looking to understand churn prediction, or someone interested in machine learning applications, this repository provides a comprehensive guide and all necessary tools for replication and further exploration.

### Data
The dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset. It can be found in the [data](data) directory. This dataset includes customer data from a telecom company, where the main goal is to predict customer churn based on various features like monthly charges, tenure, and service type.

[Datasheet for Telco Customer Churn Dataset](docs/Datasheet_for_TelcoCustomerChurnDataset.md): This datasheet provides detailed information about the motivations, composition, collection process, and pre-processing steps involved with the Telco Customer Churn dataset. It is essential for understanding the scope, limitations, and appropriate uses of the data.

### Models
The models used include Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks. Random Forest was chosen for its robustness against overfitting, Logistic Regression for its efficacy in binary outcomes, and Neural Networks for their ability to model complex relationships in high-dimensional data.

#### Random Forest
- **Description**: Utilizes ensemble learning technique for classification. Random Forest is robust against overfitting as it uses multiple decision trees to make predictions.
- **Performance**: Details about the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are documented in the Random Forest model card.

#### Logistic Regression
- **Description**: A statistical model that estimates the probability of a binary outcome based on input features. It is useful for understanding the influence of several independent variables on a binary outcome.
- **Performance**: Metrics and evaluation are available in the Logistic Regression model card.

#### Neural Network
- **Description**: Employs a deep learning architecture to model complex relationships in data. The model used here is a fully connected deep neural network, structured to capture intricate patterns in customer behavior.
- **Performance**: Evaluation results can be found in the Neural Network model card.

### Hyperparameter Optimization
Hyperparameters were optimized using Bayesian Optimization. This method was selected for its efficiency in finding the best hyperparameters by building a probability model of the objective function and using it to select the most promising hyperparameters to evaluate in the true objective function.

### Results
The models achieved varying levels of accuracy, with Logistic Regression performing the best. The results help in understanding which features most significantly predict churn, such as tenure and monthly charges. These insights assist in developing targeted interventions to reduce customer churn.
