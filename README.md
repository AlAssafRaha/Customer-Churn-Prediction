### Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting customer churn for subscription-based services. Using the Telco Customer Churn dataset, the project explores various machine learning techniques, with a special focus on Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. This project includes detailed Jupyter notebooks for each step of the processâ€”from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to model training and evaluation. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can help businesses understand and mitigate customer churn, ultimately enhancing customer retention strategies. Whether you're a data science student, a professional looking to understand churn prediction, or someone interested in machine learning applications, this repository provides a comprehensive guide and all necessary tools for replication and further exploration.
