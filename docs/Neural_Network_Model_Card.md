# Neural Network Model Card

## Model Details
- **Developer**: Raha AlAssaf
- **Model Date**: June 2, 2024
- **Model Version**: 1.0
- **Model Type**: Neural Network
- **Model Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras

## Model Description
This Neural Network model has been developed to predict customer churn in the telecommunications sector. It leverages a deep learning architecture to capture complex patterns in customer behavior and service usage, aiming to provide accurate predictions that help in retaining customers.

## Intended Use
- **Primary Use**: Predicting churn among customers of a telecom service provider.
- **Users**: Data science teams in telecom companies tasked with improving customer retention strategies.

## Training Data
- **Source**: The model was trained on the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
- **Type**: The dataset comprises customer demographics, account details, service usage, and churn labels.
- **Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing included normalization of numerical features, one-hot encoding of categorical variables, and handling of missing values.

## Evaluation Data
- **Source**: Same as training data, split into training and validation sets.
- **Preprocessing**: The evaluation data underwent the same preprocessing steps as the training data to ensure consistency in model evaluation.

## Metrics
- **Accuracy**: 79%
- **Precision**: 61%
- **Recall**: 56%
- **F1-Score**: 58%
- **AUC-ROC**: 83%

## Ethical Considerations
- **Potential Bias**: Efforts were made to identify and mitigate any bias in the training data. The model's performance was evaluated to ensure fairness across various customer segments.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Techniques such as adjusting class weights and resampling were explored to address imbalance and potential bias.

## Caveats and Recommendations
- Model Limitations: While neural networks can model complex relationships, they require large amounts of data and can overfit if not properly regularized or if trained on unrepresentative data sets.
- Operational Use: Recommended continuous monitoring of the model's performance over time with new data, and regular updates to the model architecture or training data as needed.
