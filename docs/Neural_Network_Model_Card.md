Model Details
Developer: Raha AlAssaf
Model Date: June 2, 2024
Model Version: 1.0
Model Type: Neural Network
Model Framework: TensorFlow / Keras
Model Description
This Neural Network model has been developed to predict customer churn in the telecommunications sector. It leverages a deep learning architecture to capture complex patterns in customer behavior and service usage, aiming to provide accurate predictions that help in retaining customers.

Intended Use
Primary Use: Predicting churn among customers of a telecom service provider.
Users: Data science teams in telecom companies tasked with improving customer retention strategies.
Training Data
Source: The model was trained on the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
Type: The dataset comprises customer demographics, account details, service usage, and churn labels.
Preprocessing: Data preprocessing included normalization of numerical features, one-hot encoding of categorical variables, and handling of missing values.
Evaluation Data
Source: Same as training data, split into training and validation sets.
Preprocessing: The evaluation data underwent the same preprocessing steps as the training data to ensure consistency in model evaluation.
Metrics
Accuracy: X.XX%
Precision: X.XX%
Recall: X.XX%
F1-Score: X.XX%
AUC-ROC: X.XX%
Ethical Considerations
Potential Bias: Acknowledge any potential biases identified in the training data and the steps taken to mitigate them. Discuss how the model performs across different customer groups.
Mitigation Strategies: Outline any resampling techniques, feature selection processes, or model adjustments used to ensure fairness and reduce bias.
Caveats and Recommendations
Model Limitations: While neural networks can model complex relationships, they require large amounts of data and can overfit if not properly regularized or if trained on unrepresentative data sets.
Operational Use: Recommended continuous monitoring of the model's performance over time with new data, and regular updates to the model architecture or training data as needed.
