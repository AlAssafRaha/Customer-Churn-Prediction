## Model Description
This Logistic Regression model is developed to predict customer churn in a telecommunications setting. It aims to identify customers at risk of leaving, enabling targeted interventions to improve customer retention.

Intended Use
Primary Use: To predict which customers are likely to churn from a telecom provider's services.
Users: Intended for use by customer relationship managers and data science teams within telecommunications companies.
Training Data
Source: The model was trained using the Telco Customer Churn dataset available on Kaggle.
Type: Includes customer demographics, account information, service usage, and churn labels.
Preprocessing: Data preprocessing included encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical inputs, and handling missing values.
Evaluation Data
Source: Derived from the same dataset, typically using a random train-test split.
Preprocessing: Similar preprocessing as training data to ensure consistency.
Metrics
Accuracy: X.XX%
Precision: X.XX%
Recall: X.XX%
F1-Score: X.XX%
AUC-ROC: X.XX%
Ethical Considerations
Potential Bias: Efforts were made to identify and mitigate any bias in the training data. The model's performance was evaluated to ensure fairness across various customer segments.
Mitigation Strategies: Techniques such as adjusting class weights and resampling were explored to address imbalance and potential bias.
Caveats and Recommendations
Model Limitations: Logistic Regression may not capture complex nonlinear relationships as effectively as some more sophisticated models. It is recommended to keep the model under regular review and consider ensemble methods or more complex models if predictive performance plateaus.
Use Cases: Best used for initial screening of at-risk customers followed by more detailed analysis.
