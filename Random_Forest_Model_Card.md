## Model Description
-**Description**: This Random Forest model predicts customer churn for a telecommunications company. It is designed to help identify customers at high risk of churn, allowing targeted interventions.

## Intended Use
- **Primary use**: Predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company.
- **Users**: Intended for use by data science teams within telecom companies.

## Training Data
- **Source**: The model was trained using the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle.
- **Type**: Tabular data includes customer demographics, account information, and service usage details and billing information.
- **Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

## Evaluation Data
- **Source**: The same dataset was split into training and testing sets, with an 80/20 split.
- **Preprocessing**: Similar preprocessing steps as training data.

## Metrics
- **Accuracy**: 0.80
- **Precision**: 0.67
- **Recall**: 0.50
- **F1-Score**: 0.57

## Ethical Considerations
- **Bias and fairness**: Analysis was conducted to ensure the model's fairness across various demographic groups. 

## Caveats and Recommendations
- The model's performance may vary with new data, particularly if customer behavior or market conditions change significantly. Continuous monitoring and periodic retraining with new data are recommended to maintain the model's effectiveness.
